 **Mockup UI for Technology Development Course At the University of Waterloo in the Fall of 2023**
 - The UI was insprired in an endevour to develop a product development business plan for an application to connect cosmetics professionals to clients.
 - See a complete version of the business plan report [here](https://github.com/JRomeroRepositories/Cosmo_Mockup/files/13517918/Cosmo.Product.Development.Business.Plan.-.Team.2.-.SCBUS.323.-.Fall.2023.-.University.of.Waterloo.pdf) - Note the report has additional authors.
 - Mockup development period was <5 hrs total, due to class time constraints.
 - Mockup structure is entirely hardcoded for UI to serve in a pitch environment only.
